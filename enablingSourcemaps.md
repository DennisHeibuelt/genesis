#Enabling sourcemaps in Chrome Canary

- Enable the developers experiments
- In the General settings in the Sources section enable 'CSS source maps' and 'Auto-reload generated CSS'
- Add the Project-Folder (in this case 'genesis') as a Workspace
- Go to "Sources" and choose the css-file which the Browser takes for displaying the styles (find it at 'localhost:8000/dist/assets/css/style.css'). Rightclick it and map it to file system resource. Choose the css-file of your Project-Folder (in this case 'genesis/app/assets/css/style.css'), NOT the one, which is copied in the dist-Folder.
- VoilÃ¡

###Prerequisities
